This compiler uses the Elkhound parser generator.

To install elkhound (after building it), run something similar to the following commands in the elkhound directory:

# Copy executable.
cp elkhound /usr/local/bin/

# Copy libs.
cp libelkhound.a /usr/local/lib/
cp ../smbase/libsmbase.a /usr/local/lib/
cp ../ast/libast.a /usr/local/lib/

# Copy headers.
mkdir /usr/local/include/elkhound/
cp *.h /usr/local/include/elkhound/
cp ../smbase/*.h /usr/local/include/elkhound/
cp ../ast/*.h /usr/local/include/elkhound/

# Redirect includes in headers to use installed header folder.
find /usr/local/include/elkhound/ -name "*.h" -exec sed -i "s/include \"\(.*\)\"/include <elkhound\/\1>/g" '{}' \;
